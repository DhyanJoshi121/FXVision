# Welcome to developer log

### what is developer log?
=> Nothing major, it's just documentation but for myself.

### what is purpose of this?
=> write whatever the fuck you want, without giving shit about anyone. make spelling mistakc or write your dumb thoughts while you are working on solving problem. 

----

#### so whats the idea?
=> well idea is big and ambitious, so I wanted to create some awesome and complex and also something that I enjoy. quite the hard criteria so it took me about 2 days to come up with good idea. And the idea is to create charting website for traders and investor but AI enhanced. 

well AI is so far as if right now, because just the basic calculation for chart are going to take long time.

---

### Let's start

1. ok so let's start with some simple shit like drawing basic canvas with grid
it should be easy right? 
right?
no, I don't even have clue on what to do, I made function drawgrid and setup the nice background thats as far as my knowledge goes but now what?

so I know how to make line and move and I know i have to do some type of for loop
ok nice, so we can loop over the canvas width and skip certain pixels
ideally this should work, let's see

well it did work ![image](./dev/first grid.png)
